# Meme Generator
Hai, i just want to share my second small javascript project. (2)

## About
For this project, i use meme API that you can check on his repo [here](https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api) <br />
It is simple like quotes_generator before, you just need to know about javascript DOM, how to fetch data from API, and other basic Javascript <br />
I learn how to get width and height from the url photo, you can check on my getImageSize function
